# Twitch Dashboard
A simple React webapp that displays the top livestreams currently online at twitch.tv, with built-in game search and pagination features.
I built this app in Spring of 2019 as a trail project for my software engineering internship at [Primed Mind](https://primedmind.com/).

The current production version of this app is available [here](https://twitchdashboard.surge.sh/)


### Tools Used
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


### Known Current Bugs
- Pagination leading to all white page on page back and home -- might have to do with expired access tokens or state transfers?
